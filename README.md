# Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD300) Implemented in PyTorch

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD300) using PyTorch. SSD is a popular object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy.

## Features

- Implementation of SSD300 architecture
- PyTorch-based model
- Object detection on custom datasets
- Pre-trained weights support

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.7+
- torchvision
- numpy
- Pillow
- matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/kap2403/single-shot-multibox-detector-ssd300-implemented-by-pytorch.git


## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
- Organize your images and annotations in the required format
- Update the dataset paths in the configuration file

2. Train the model: python train.py
3. Evaluate the model: python evaluate.py



## Model Architecture

SSD300 is a single-stage object detection model that uses a base network (typically VGG16) followed by multi-scale feature maps for detection. It employs default boxes (similar to anchor boxes) and performs classification and bounding box regression in a single forward pass.

## Results

[Include information about the model's performance, mAP scores, and any visualizations]
